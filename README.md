# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform that enables donaters around the world to donate to organizations and causes. To understand what makes a successful campaign, an analysis was performed on Kickstarter data from 2009 - 2017 for a variety of different categories, e.g. theater, concerts, and television. The analysis revealed that the outcome of campaigns correlated strongly with their launch date. A majority of the campaigns that failed set their funding goals far higher than the successful campaigns. However, the average pledges of successful campaigns were higher than the 50th percentile (median) of the failed campaigns, meaning the failed campaigns failed for reasons beyond setting their funding goals too high. Although our client plans on setting a funding goal of $4,000, it is reccomended that the value be placed closer to $2,000, as the latter is within range for what donaters are willing to give. In fact, theater was the category with the highest success rate, as the seen in the stacked bar graph. From the line graph, the month with the higest success rate is May, so this would be the best time to launch the kickstarter. In summary, initiating a kickstarter in the early summer, especially the month of May, would likely be successful for both plays and musicals, as long as the funding goal is around $2000. Launching in June would be a viable second option.
